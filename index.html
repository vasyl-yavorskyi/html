        <p>— FACTS ABOUT THE WIND ENERGY</p>
        <h2>How Can Windmills Change the World?</h2>
        <p>The wind is an inexhaustible source of energy. In some countries of the world, wind farms already feed entire cities, and at the same time, they do not harm nature and do not create discomfort.</p>
        <dl>
            <dt><h3>Do windmills give stable energy?</h3></dt>
            <dd>Yes. When installed correctly, the wind generator will generate electricity 365 days a year.</dd>
            <dt><h3>What is the working lifespan of a windmill?</h3></dt>
            <dd>With proper installation and timely maintenance, the wind generator will work up to 30 years.</dd>
            <dt><h3>How loud is the wind generator?</h3></dt>
            <dd>In an operating mode, the wind turbine reaches 25 dB. For comparison, a wall clock is ticking at a volume of 30 dB.</dd>
            <dt><h3>Is a windmill safe for the environment?</h3></dt>
            <dd>Absolutely. During operation, not a single type of fuel is used, therefore, there are zero emissions from the wind generator.</dd>
